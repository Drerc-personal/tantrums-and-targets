            <h3>Regime Warning Active</h3>
            <p>8 Track 2 triggers in the last 10 days. This is a broad institutional de-risking environment, not stock-specific opportunity. Track 2 entries suspended. Focus on Track 3 GTC targets only.</p>

        <h2>Market Snapshot</h2>
        <p>A mixed session with 13 stocks triggering alerts -- the highest count since the experiment began. The breadth of alerts reinforces the regime warning: when everything is flashing, nothing is actionable. Notable movers: MSFT +3.1% (relief bounce after recent selloff), NVO +3.6% (dead cat bounce), ROP -3.0% (continued slide toward 52-week low).</p>

        <h2>Top 3 Candidates: Full Analysis</h2>

        <h3>MSFT -- Microsoft (Track 3)</h3>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> $413.60 (+3.1%) | <strong>Target:</strong> $450 (START) / $445 (ADD) | <strong>Distance:</strong> -8.1% from target</p>
        <p><strong>Position:</strong> Already own 12 shares @ $447.25 (-5.3%)</p>

        <p><strong>The Narrator</strong> was aggressive here, recommending ADD with 90% confidence. The argument: MSFT at 21.9x forward earnings represents a ~31% discount to its 5-year average of 32x. Azure infrastructure spending positions Microsoft as the "toll bridge" of the AI era. The Narrator called for a DAY limit order at $401.14 (prior close).</p>

        <p><strong>The Auditor</strong> flagged two problems. First, the "ELIGIBLE TO ADD" label in the prompt is misleading -- current price ($413.60) is well above the prior close limit ($401.14), so the order likely wouldn't fill. Second, a DAY order is Track 2 mechanics, not Track 3. The Auditor's instinct was correct: discipline over enthusiasm.</p>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h3>The Human Override</h3>
            <p>The portfolio manager (E) overruled both AIs on MSFT, calling the recommendation "categorically stupid." The reasoning:</p>
            <p>1. <strong>Concentration risk:</strong> MSFT is already the largest position at 12 shares (~$5K invested). Adding 5 more would dangerously overweight one name.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Hold zone, not ADD zone:</strong> Track 3 rules say ADD at the ADD target ($445), not at any price below the start target ($450). Current price ($413.60) is in the hold zone.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>Wrong order type:</strong> Track 3 uses GTC limit orders at defined target levels, not DAY orders at prior close. DAY orders are Track 2 mechanics.</p>
            <p><strong>This is the system working as designed.</strong> The human checks the AI when the AI drifts from methodology. Three AI analysts pattern-matched "cheap valuation + quality company" and forgot the rules.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Arbiter Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span> -- Already own 12 shares. In hold zone between target ($450) and ADD target ($445). No action until ADD target hit.</p>

        <h3>FICO -- Fair Isaac (Track 3)</h3>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> $1,372.76 (-1.3%) | <strong>Target:</strong> $1,400 (START) / $1,300 (ADD) | <strong>Distance:</strong> -1.9% from target</p>
        <p><strong>Position:</strong> Already own 1 share @ $1,623.97 (-10.7%)</p>

        <p><strong>The Narrator</strong> identified regulatory overhang as the primary catalyst -- CFPB action fears and VantageScore competition with GSEs. Forward P/E at 26.1x vs 40x 5-year average suggests the market is pricing in meaningful regulatory risk. Recommended HOLD and waiting for the $1,300 ADD target.</p>

        <p><strong>The Auditor</strong> agreed. The thesis remains intact (FICO is deeply embedded in global finance plumbing with immense switching costs), but the price hasn't reached ADD levels yet. Patience warranted.</p>

        <p><strong>Arbiter Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span> -- Consensus. Wait for ADD target at $1,300.</p>

        <h3>NVO -- Novo Nordisk (Track 3)</h3>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> $49.37 (+3.6%) | <strong>Target:</strong> $50 (START) / $45 (ADD) | <strong>Distance:</strong> -1.3% from target</p>
        <p><strong>P/E Compression Warning:</strong> Trailing P/E 13.1x vs 5Y average 30x (44% of historical) -- possible structural re-rating</p>

        <p><strong>The Narrator</strong> correctly identified this as structural, not cyclical. Eli Lilly's tirzepatide is winning the efficacy and pricing war. Novo's 2026 guidance calls for 5-13% decline in sales and profit. The "golden era" for Novo's GLP-1 dominance appears to be ending. Recommended NONE with 70% confidence -- wait for the narrative to find a floor.</p>

        <p><strong>The Auditor</strong> agreed. The P/E compression warning (installed after the Feb 6 "buggy whip" lesson) is working as designed -- it forced both AIs to ask "why is this so cheap?" rather than "what a bargain!"</p>

        <p><strong>Arbiter Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span> -- Thesis weakening. Structural competitive loss to Lilly, not a tantrum. The P/E compression detector earned its keep today.</p>

            <h3>Process Note: The Human Override</h3>
            <p>Today marks the first time the portfolio manager explicitly overruled all three AI analysts on a specific recommendation. Two out of three AIs (the Narrator and the initial Arbiter synthesis) recommended adding to MSFT via a DAY limit order at prior close.</p>
            <p>The human caught three methodology violations the AIs missed: concentration risk (MSFT already largest position), wrong price zone (hold zone, not ADD zone), and wrong order type (DAY order is Track 2, not Track 3). This is exactly what the human-in-the-loop is for -- catching pattern-matching that overrides rules.</p>
            <p><strong>Lesson reinforced:</strong> "Cheap" is not the same as "actionable." A quality stock below its start target but above its ADD target is in the hold zone. The rules exist for a reason.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Calendar Flags</h2>
        <p><strong>FICO:</strong> Watch for CFPB regulatory news. Any formal action on credit scoring pricing would be material.</p>
        <p><strong>NVO:</strong> Next earnings critical for thesis reassessment. If 2026 guidance deteriorates further, consider removing from watchlist at annual review.</p>
        <p><strong>MCO &amp; VRSN:</strong> Both sitting right at target prices. If the broad selloff continues, GTCs may fill soon.</p>
