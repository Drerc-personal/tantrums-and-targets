        <div class="thesis-break">
            <h3>Thesis Removed: NVO (Novo Nordisk)</h3>
            <p>NVO dropped another -16.4% today to $39.63, continuing a structural collapse. The Auditor recommended BUY at 71%. The Narrator flagged it as a falling knife at 55%. <strong>Both overruled.</strong></p>
            <p>The Arbiter ruled on Feb 6: NVO&rsquo;s thesis is broken. Lilly is winning on efficacy (20.2% vs 13.7% weight loss), pricing power, and patent protection. NVO guided for 5&ndash;13% sales decline in 2026. This is not a tantrum. <strong>Removed from active watchlist.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="thesis-warning">
            <h3>Thesis Watch: FICO (Fair Isaac) &mdash; Weakening</h3>
            <p>FICO dropped -5.1% today to $1,281.64, near its 52-week low of $1,268. We now own 2 shares at an average cost of ~$1,512 &mdash; currently down ~15%.</p>
            <p>The second share filled via GTC at $1,400.03 on Feb 3, <em>before</em> we discovered the FHFA/VantageScore regulatory threat on Feb 12. That&rsquo;s not a bad decision &mdash; it&rsquo;s new information arriving after disciplined entry. But it stings, and it&rsquo;s a reminder that GTCs can fill into deteriorating theses if we&rsquo;re not monitoring.</p>
            <p><strong>The business is still executing:</strong> Q1 2026 revenue up 16% YoY, EPS beat by 3.7%, Scores segment up 29%, 54% operating margins, Mortgage Direct Licensing Program covering 70&ndash;80% of the reseller market.</p>
            <p><strong>But the monopoly moat is under regulatory attack:</strong> FHFA eliminated the FICO requirement from the GSE lending guide. VantageScore 4.0 is now an approved alternative. 134 insider sells, 0 insider buys. Full-year guidance of $2.35B trails Street estimates by 4&ndash;6%.</p>
            <p><strong>Arbiter ruling:</strong> Thesis remains WEAKENING. 90-day review clock active from Feb 12. Hold 2 shares. Do NOT add. The question &ldquo;are we directionally right but too early?&rdquo; is valid &mdash; at 24x forward on a business growing 16%, FICO could be genuinely cheap if VantageScore adoption stays single-digit. But we don&rsquo;t risk new capital until the regulatory trajectory clarifies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="thesis-warning">
            <h3>Thesis Check Needed: CPRT (Copart)</h3>
            <p>Our largest new fill &mdash; 60 shares @ $34.40 on Feb 20 &mdash; came the same day CPRT reported a Q2 earnings miss. Revenue of $1.12B declined 3.6% YoY and missed estimates. EPS of $0.36 missed the $0.39 consensus by 7.5%. Operating margin fell to 34.7% from 36.6%. JPMorgan cut their price target to $34. Barclays has an underweight at $32.</p>
            <p><strong>The bull case:</strong> Free cash flow is actually up significantly &mdash; $485M year-to-date, trending toward ~$970M for the full year. Capex was cut nearly in half. The salvage auction model is counter-cyclical long-term (more accidents = more volume). The stock is 43% below its 52-week high.</p>
            <p><strong>The concern:</strong> Revenue declining 3.6% YoY with shrinking margins is new. This needs honest scrutiny, not a rubber stamp. Is this a temporary volume dip, or is the salvage market structurally softening?</p>
            <p><strong>Arbiter ruling:</strong> Hold the position. Flag for full thesis review next session. The fill was disciplined (GTC at target), but post-fill earnings require us to re-evaluate. ADD target of $32 should NOT be deployed until the thesis check clears.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>AI Analyst Conflicts &amp; Resolutions</h2>

        <h3>FICO: Auditor vs Arbiter</h3>
        <p>The Auditor recommended ADD at 78% confidence, citing valuation below historical average. <strong>Overruled.</strong> The Feb 12 thesis downgrade to WEAKENING takes precedence. Same &ldquo;cheap + quality = buy&rdquo; pattern-matching that nearly led us into NVO.</p>

        <h3>NVO: Auditor vs Everyone</h3>
        <p>The Auditor recommended BUY at 71% confidence. <strong>Overruled.</strong> Thesis is broken. The Auditor needs to incorporate thesis status into its rule check &mdash; &ldquo;rules satisfied&rdquo; is meaningless when the thesis is broken.</p>

        <h3>CPRT: All Initially Agreed &mdash; Now Needs Revisiting</h3>
        <p>The Narrator called CPRT the &ldquo;vulture of the insurance industry&rdquo; at 85% confidence. Three days later the company missed on revenue, earnings, and margins. Confidence levels mean nothing if the data changes. Flag for review.</p>

        <h2>Candidates</h2>

        <h3>V &mdash; Visa ($306.52, GTC filled today)</h3>
        <p><strong>Catalyst:</strong> Payment volume slowdown fears. Down -4.5%.</p>

        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge filled">FILLED</span> &mdash; Thesis intact. Payment network duopoly moat. Wait for ADD target $300.</p>

        <h3>MCO &mdash; Moody&rsquo;s ($437.11, Hold Zone)</h3>
        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span> &mdash; Own 6 shares. Wait for ADD target $430.</p>

        <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h3>On Targets and the New World</h3>
            <p>Multiple GTC orders filled at targets that were set in a different market regime. FICO&rsquo;s target assumed an unchallenged monopoly. CPRT&rsquo;s target assumed revenue growth, not decline. TYL&rsquo;s target assumed premium valuations for government software before AI disruption fears.</p>
            <p>Being &ldquo;directionally right but too early&rdquo; is the cost of systematic investing during regime transitions. The system caught us falling prices &mdash; which is what it&rsquo;s designed to do &mdash; but the world shifted underneath some of those targets.</p>
            <p><strong>Next session priority:</strong> A full target review. Position by position, ask: &ldquo;Given what we know now, would we set the same START and ADD targets?&rdquo; Some targets may need to be lowered. Some positions may need their ADD orders paused. The system is sound &mdash; but the inputs need to reflect current reality, not last quarter&rsquo;s assumptions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h3>On Getting Cooked</h3>
            <p>The portfolio is down 7.8% while VOO is down only 1.3%. The gap hurts. But this is a five-week-old experiment accumulating de-rated moats during a narrow-leadership market. The system was designed for this: suppress emotional buying, let GTCs work, preserve cash for deeper legs.</p>
            <p>Every position except FICO has an intact thesis. CPRT needs a post-earnings review. The regime warning is firing correctly. The rules are being followed. Abandoning the system now locks in the pain and misses the recovery.</p>
            <p>The question is not &ldquo;can we beat the market&rdquo; &mdash; it is &ldquo;are we executing our rules?&rdquo; The answer is yes.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Calendar Flags</h2>
        <p><strong>CPRT:</strong> Full thesis review needed next session. Revenue decline + margin compression post-fill.</p>
        <p><strong>FICO:</strong> 90-day review clock from Feb 12. Check VantageScore GSE adoption by mid-May. Next earnings May 6.</p>
        <p><strong>V:</strong> New fill today. Monitor payment volume trends. ADD target $300.</p>
        <p><strong>Target Review:</strong> Highest priority for next session. Reassess all START and ADD targets against current fundamentals.</p>
        <p><strong>Tracker Update:</strong> 3 unrecorded fills need ingestion (FICO Feb 3, TYL Jan 30, ROP Jan 30).</p>
