        <h1>Fundamental Analysis</h1>
        <p class="text-muted">Deep-dive analyses of individual stocks using Template v1.0. Each report covers business identity, financial health, valuation, moat assessment, risks, thesis status, and a verdict with derived price targets.</p>

        <div class="method-section">
            <h3>How We Use These</h3>
            <p>Fundamental analyses are triggered when a stock's thesis needs reassessment &mdash; usually after a structural change, not routine price movement. Three AI analysts (the Auditor, the Narrator, and the Arbiter) independently evaluate the company, then the Arbiter synthesizes a final verdict with explicit price targets derived from forward earnings and peer multiples.</p>
            <p>These are not buy recommendations. They are decision memos that document <em>why</em> a target was set and <em>what would change it</em>.</p>
