        <h3>Analyst Performance Notes</h3>
        <p><strong>The Auditor (ChatGPT):</strong> Outstanding session. The TYL analysis was the sharpest of the day, correctly distinguishing between a tantrum and a repricing: &ldquo;Painful hold. Not broken. Not cheap.&rdquo; Properly flagged that 20x forward P/E on 8% growth guidance is not screaming cheap for a government IT vendor. Emotional averaging risk was called out explicitly.</p>
        <p><strong>The Narrator (Gemini):</strong> Correctly recommended NONE across all candidates. Properly identified the TYL catalyst as a double-whammy of earnings miss plus macro repricing. FHFA/VantageScore narrative context was useful.</p>

        <h2>Feature: Tyler Technologies Crashes &mdash; Tantrum or Repricing?</h2>

        <p>Tyler Technologies dropped 15.4% in a single day after reporting Q4 2025 earnings. Revenue of $575M missed estimates of $591M. EPS of $2.64 missed the $2.71 consensus. Management guided for 8% revenue growth in 2026, a significant deceleration from its 15% annualized growth rate over the past five years.</p>

        <p>However, management also raised full-year 2026 EPS guidance to $12.40&ndash;$12.65, well above the Street consensus of $11.49. SaaS revenue grew 20%. And approximately 50% of Tyler&rsquo;s customer base is still on-premise, representing a massive cloud conversion runway.</p>

        <p>The Auditor&rsquo;s framework was precise:</p>

        <table class="consensus-table">
            <tr><th>Test</th><th>Result</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Thesis broken?</td><td class="pass">No &mdash; cloud bookings not below 10%, government pipeline not impaired</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Drop tantrum-like?</td><td class="pass">Yes &mdash; 15% single-day drop on earnings miss</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Valuation cheap enough to force action?</td><td class="fail">No &mdash; 20x forward on 8% growth is not screaming value</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Regime allows entry?</td><td class="fail">No &mdash; 13 Track 2 triggers, regime warning active</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Already have exposure?</td><td class="watch">Yes &mdash; existing position down ~30%</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Verdict: Painful hold. Not broken. Not cheap.</strong> This is multiple compression on a high-quality business, not structural impairment. But buying here would be emotional averaging, not disciplined entry. The system says wait.</p>

        <div class="thesis-warning">
            <h3>Thesis Alert: FICO &mdash; Monopoly Under Siege</h3>
            <p>FICO&rsquo;s credit scoring monopoly is under active regulatory attack. FHFA Director Bill Pulte eliminated the FICO requirement from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac&rsquo;s lending guide, allowing lenders to use VantageScore 4.0 as an alternative. VantageScore, developed by the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion), claims to be 13% more predictive of mortgage defaults than Classic FICO.</p>
            <p>FICO&rsquo;s exit criteria states: &ldquo;VantageScore gains &gt;30% GSE market share.&rdquo; We are not there yet &mdash; adoption is early, with about 40 lenders using FICO 10T so far, mostly for non-conforming products. But the regulatory trajectory is clear: the government wants competition in credit scoring.</p>
            <p><strong>Arbiter ruling:</strong> Thesis status changed from INTACT to WEAKENING. Hold existing position. Do NOT add. 90-day review to reassess VantageScore adoption trajectory.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Candidates</h2>

        <h3>TYL &mdash; Tyler Technologies ($287, -15.4% today)</h3>
        <p><strong>Catalyst:</strong> Q4 earnings miss. Revenue $575M vs $591M expected. EPS $2.64 vs $2.71 expected. FY26 growth guidance decelerated to 8%.</p>
        <p><strong>Valuation:</strong> Forward P/E 20.1x vs 5Y average 55x. Trailing P/E 47.1x. Lowest valuation since 2011.</p>
        <p><strong>Risk type:</strong> Execution + Tech Narrative (AI disruption fears across SaaS sector)</p>
        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span> &mdash; Regime rules prohibit Track 2 entry. Thesis intact but valuation not compelling enough to override.</p>

        <h3>FICO &mdash; Fair Isaac ($1,338, approaching ADD target)</h3>
        <p><strong>Catalyst:</strong> FHFA regulatory action allowing VantageScore competition. Stock down 42% from peak.</p>
        <p><strong>Valuation:</strong> Forward P/E 25.4x vs 5Y average 40x. Q1 2026 earnings beat (EPS $7.33 vs $7.07 expected).</p>
        <p><strong>Risk type:</strong> Structural / Legal-Regulatory</p>
        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span> &mdash; Thesis weakening. Monopoly under regulatory attack. Do not add until reassessed.</p>

        <h3>ROP &mdash; Roper Technologies ($320, near 52-week low)</h3>
        <p><strong>Catalyst:</strong> Broad software sector selloff. Down -4.2% today.</p>
        <p><strong>Valuation:</strong> Forward P/E 13.7x vs 5Y average 30x. Significant compression.</p>
        <p><strong>Risk type:</strong> Cyclical + Tech Narrative</p>
        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span> &mdash; Thesis needs review. Largest position with deepest drawdown. Check organic growth rate before any action.</p>

        <h3>CPRT &mdash; Copart ($36.72, -7.1% today)</h3>
        <p><strong>Catalyst:</strong> Broad market selloff. Approaching GTC target at $34.97.</p>
        <p><strong>Valuation:</strong> Forward P/E 20.4x vs 5Y average 30x.</p>
        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span> &mdash; GTC at $34.97 working. 5% away. Let it fill organically.</p>

        <h3>MCO, JKHY, NVO, V, VRSN, MSFT, BAC, VOO, IDXX, RSG</h3>
        <p>All <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span>. GTCs working where applicable. Hold zones respected. Regime warning active. No action required.</p>

            <h3>Lesson: The System Under Maximum Stress</h3>
            <p>February 12, 2026 was the most intense day since the experiment began. 14 alerts fired simultaneously. The largest single-day drop hit our own holding (TYL -15.4%). FICO&rsquo;s monopoly moat came under direct regulatory attack. The portfolio hit -8.5% while VOO was down only -1.5%.</p>
            <p>The system&rsquo;s response: zero new trades. The regime warning suppressed every Track 2 impulse. The cool-down rule prevented mechanical pyramiding. Cash was preserved for deeper legs. One GTC (JKHY) filled on its own, exactly at target, without emotional intervention.</p>
            <p>This is what discipline looks like when it hurts. The system wasn&rsquo;t built for days when everything is green. It was built for days like this.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Calendar Flags</h2>
        <p><strong>TYL:</strong> Read Q4 earnings call transcript. Key questions: cloud bookings growth rate, government pipeline health, Texas contract termination impact, AI agentic capabilities timeline.</p>
        <p><strong>FICO:</strong> 90-day thesis review due by mid-May. Monitor VantageScore adoption rate among GSE lenders. Key metric: what percentage of new conforming loans use VantageScore vs FICO?</p>
        <p><strong>ROP:</strong> Thesis review needed immediately. Check most recent quarterly organic growth rate against the 4% exit threshold.</p>
        <p><strong>CPRT:</strong> GTC at $34.97 is 5% away. Could fill this week if selloff continues.</p>
        <p><strong>JKHY:</strong> New position. ADD target at $150 ($7 away). Monitor for drift.</p>
        <p><strong>Tracker:</strong> Position data needs correction. Several share counts and cost bases appear inaccurate in the automated prompt. Manual verification required before next roundtable.</p>
