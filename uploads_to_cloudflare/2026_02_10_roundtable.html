        <h1>Roundtable: February 10, 2026</h1>
        <p class="text-muted"><strong>The SPGI Contagion:</strong> Two GTC fills, the DNA test, and discipline in a falling market.</p>

        <div class="regime-warning">
            <h3>Regime Warning Active</h3>
            <p>Regime warning remains in effect. S&amp;P Global (SPGI) issued a 2026 outlook that missed analyst estimates, triggering a sharp selloff that dragged financial data peers down with it. Moody's (MCO) gapped down -6.8% in sympathy. This is sector contagion, not isolated opportunity.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Today's Fills</h2>
        <p>Two existing GTC limit orders filled today. The portfolio manager had placed reduced-size GTC orders given the active regime warning and elevated crash risk.</p>

        <table>
            <tr><th>Ticker</th><th>GTC Limit</th><th>Fill Price</th><th>Shares</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="ticker">MCO</td>
                <td>$450.00</td>
                <td><span class="pass">$412.00</span></td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>Price improvement from SPGI gap-down. $38 below limit.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="ticker">VRSN</td>
                <td>$220.00</td>
                <td><span class="pass">$219.24</span></td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>Filled near 52-week low zone.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Both fills are rule-compliant GTC executions. The MCO fill was particularly notable -- the SPGI contagion created an air-pocket at the open, and our resting GTC received $38 of price improvement. This is exactly what patient limit orders are designed to do.</p>

        <h2>Top Candidates: Full Analysis</h2>

        <h3>MCO -- Moody's Corporation (Track 3)</h3>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ~$412 (gapped from $449.47 prior close) | <strong>Target:</strong> $450 (START) / $430 (ADD) | <strong>Fill:</strong> 1 share @ $412.00</p>

        <p><strong>The Narrator</strong> provided the key insight: SPGI's weak 2026 outlook triggered a sector-wide repricing of the "toll bridge" business model in financial data. The market questioned whether the 2024-2025 bond refinancing boom may be slowing. MCO fell in sympathy despite no company-specific news. Adding to negative sentiment, per SEC Form 4 filings, CEO Robert Fauber sold 1,167 shares across February 2-3 at prices between $498.90 and $516.15 under a pre-planned Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted July 30, 2025 -- routine pre-scheduled transactions, but the timing amplified the optics.</p>

        <p><strong>The Auditor</strong> noted that MCO's trailing P/E of ~36x still sits above the 5-year average of 32x, meaning the stock isn't cheap by historical standards even after the selloff. However, the GTC fill was rule-compliant (price improvement on a resting order), and the ratings oligopoly moat remains intact.</p>

        <p><strong>Arbiter synthesis:</strong> This is cyclical risk (issuance volumes), not structural impairment. The ratings oligopoly has survived every credit cycle for decades. MCO is not trying to become something it isn't -- ratings and analytics are natural adjacencies. The fill was good execution. Now wait for the ADD target at $430.</p>

        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge buy">FILLED</span> 1 share @ $412.00. No further action. Wait for ADD target $430.</p>

        <h3>VRSN -- Verisign (Track 3)</h3>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ~$219.24 | <strong>Target:</strong> $220 (START) / $200 (ADD) | <strong>Fill:</strong> 2 shares @ $219.24</p>

        <p><strong>The Narrator</strong> identified the catalyst as continued weakness following a Q4 EPS miss ($2.23 reported vs $2.35 expected) on February 5. The stock has fallen over 30% from its 52-week high. Despite this, Verisign maintains a near-50% net margin -- this is the plumbing of the internet on sale.</p>

        <p><strong>The Auditor</strong> confirmed the fill as rule-compliant and flagged the correct next step: wait for the $200 ADD target.</p>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h3>VRSN CapEx Clarification</h3>
            <p>The Narrator initially flagged "AI-related CapEx" as a concern. Fact-checking the February 5 earnings call reveals an important nuance: Verisign guided 2026 CapEx to $55-65 million (above typical range), but CFO John Calys attributed this to "end-of-life equipment replacements" and "planned capacity expansion" facing "significantly higher costs largely attributable to intense AI industry driven demand and supply constraints." Management also cited planned capital improvement projects at corporate headquarters.</p>
            <p><strong>Translation:</strong> Verisign is NOT spending on AI initiatives. Their core infrastructure equipment simply costs more because AI-driven demand has tightened hardware supply chains. This is cost inflation, not DNA drift. The registry monopoly business model is unchanged. <strong>DNA test: PASS.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge buy">FILLED</span> 2 shares @ $219.24. No further action. Wait for ADD target $200.</p>

        <h2>The DNA Test</h2>
        <p>The portfolio manager introduced a new analytical framework today: the <strong>DNA test</strong>. Companies that try to become something they're not tend to destroy value -- Cisco buying Webex (a networking company trying to own UX), Microsoft with Zune and Nokia (a software company making consumer hardware). The question for every stock on the watchlist: does the thesis depend on the company succeeding outside its core DNA?</p>

            <tr><td><strong>MSFT</strong></td><td class="pass">PASS</td><td>AI/cloud is natural extension of enterprise software platform. Not Zune/Nokia.</td></tr>

            <h3>New Framework: The DNA Test</h3>
            <p>Starting today, every watchlist stock gets a DNA test at the annual review (and whenever a thesis is questioned mid-year). The question: is the company's growth strategy a natural extension of its core competency, or is it trying to become something it's not?</p>
            <p>Historical examples of DNA failure: Cisco/Webex (networking company buying a UX product), Microsoft/Zune and Nokia (software company making consumer hardware), IBM's consulting pivot (hardware/software company becoming a services firm).</p>
            <p>All 25 watchlist names pass the DNA test as of today. NVO's issue is competitive execution loss within its core domain, not DNA drift.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Calendar Flags</h2>
        <p><strong>MCO:</strong> Watch SPGI follow-through. If issuance volumes stabilize, MCO recovers. If SPGI guidance proves prescient, prepare for ADD at $430.</p>
        <p><strong>VRSN:</strong> Feb 5 earnings call confirmed CapEx increase is infrastructure cost inflation, not a pivot. Monitor margins going forward.</p>
        <p><strong>FICO:</strong> Now at $1,381 -- approaching the $1,300 ADD target. Stay alert.</p>
        <p><strong>NVO:</strong> Next earnings will determine whether to keep on watchlist or remove at annual review.</p>
