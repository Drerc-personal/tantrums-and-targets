        <h1>Roundtable: February 11, 2026</h1>
        <p class="text-muted"><strong>The Internal Bear Market:</strong> Portfolio -6.9% while VOO flat. The regime warning earns its keep. Zero trades.</p>

        <div class="regime-warning">
            <h3>Regime Warning: Maximum Intensity</h3>
            <p>11 Track 2 triggers in the last 10 days (threshold: 5). This is more than double the warning threshold. Track 2 entries suspended. Track 3 GTC discipline only. The system is in full defensive posture.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Big Picture: An Internal Bear Market</h2>

        <p>Today's roundtable surfaced a question that cuts to the heart of the experiment: if our high-moat, high-quality stocks are down 10-20% while the S&amp;P 500 is flat, what does that tell us?</p>

        <table>
            <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Value</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Portfolio Value</td><td>$37,238</td></tr>
            <tr><td>VOO Return (since inception)</td><td>+0.0%</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Portfolio Return</td><td>-6.9%</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Alpha vs VOO</td><td class="fail">-6.9%</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Cash</td><td>~$13,200</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Positions</td><td>7 of 25</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>The Auditor's data-grounded analysis was sharp: this is a classic "internal bear market" where narrow AI leadership props up the index while quality compounders get repriced. The evidence is in our own portfolio:</p>

        <table class="consensus-table">
            <tr><th>Ticker</th><th>Drawdown from Cost Basis</th><th>Quality Signal</th></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>TYL</strong></td><td class="fail">-17.8%</td><td>Government software monopoly</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>FICO</strong></td><td class="fail">-16.1%</td><td>Credit scoring monopoly</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>ROP</strong></td><td class="fail">-15.2%</td><td>Software compounder</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>MSFT</strong></td><td class="fail">-9.6%</td><td>Enterprise software platform</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>MCO</strong></td><td class="fail">-7.1%</td><td>Ratings oligopoly</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>VRSN</strong></td><td class="watch">-1.9%</td><td>Internet registry monopoly</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>WM</strong></td><td class="pass">+3.6%</td><td>Waste services duopoly</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>These are not low-quality names. These are Tier 1 compounders with durable moats. When this many quality stocks are simultaneously underwater, the signal is: <strong>this is macro/regime repricing, not thesis impairment.</strong></p>

        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h3>What the Data Says About the S&amp;P 500</h3>
            <p>The S&amp;P 500 is a market-cap weighted index. When the largest names (AI-linked megacaps) hold up, the index looks calm even while dozens of profitable, wide-moat businesses are down 25-50%. The top 10 companies now represent roughly 40% of the index's total market capitalization (UNCITED).</p>
            <p>The combination of VOO flat + median quality stock down 10-20% means the index is being propped up by a narrow leadership cohort. This is historically unstable. When narrative premiums deflate, the index falls faster than diversified quality baskets rebound.</p>
            <p><strong>Our portfolio is functionally "what the S&amp;P 500 looks like when the narrative premium comes off."</strong> That's uncomfortable now -- but it's exactly the environment our system was built for.</p>

        <h3>Analyst Performance Notes</h3>
        <p><strong>The Auditor (ChatGPT):</strong> Strong session. After being redirected from a theoretical macro essay back to the actual portfolio data, the Auditor delivered a sharp five-point analysis grounded in our numbers. Key insight: "pre-earnings multiple compression" -- multiples are compressing before actual earnings deterioration, which is how regime shifts begin. Best Auditor work to date.</p>
        <p><strong>The Narrator (Gemini):</strong> Corrected from yesterday. Better use of UNCITED labels on macro statistics. However, still recommended an MCO ADD despite the stock being in the hold zone (between start target and ADD target) and a fill occurring just yesterday. Pattern-matching "cheap + quality = buy" continues to override rules awareness.</p>

        <h2>Candidates</h2>

        <h3>TYL -- Tyler Technologies (Track 2 trigger: -5.9%)</h3>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ~$339 | <strong>Target:</strong> $400 (START) / $380 (ADD) | <strong>Signal:</strong> Single-day drop exceeding 5%</p>

        <p>Track 2 trigger during an active regime warning with 11 triggers in 10 days. The rules are explicit and all three analysts agree: skip Track 2 entries during broad selloffs. TYL's drop appears driven by an Oppenheimer price target reduction (UNCITED) and broader software sector repricing, not company-specific impairment. Cloud bookings growth and government contract pipeline remain the checkpoints to watch when the regime warning eventually clears.</p>

        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span> -- Regime rules mandate skip. Thesis intact. Revisit when regime clears.</p>

        <h3>MCO -- Moody's (Track 3)</h3>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ~$419 | <strong>Target:</strong> $450 (START) / $430 (ADD) | <strong>Position:</strong> 1 share @ $412 (bought yesterday)</p>

        <p>MCO is technically in the ADD zone (below the $430 ADD target). However, we just filled yesterday. Adding again 24 hours later during a regime warning with the portfolio at -6.9% would be mechanically correct but procedurally reckless. The Auditor proposed a cool-down rule: no ADDs within 1-3 trading days of a fill during a regime warning unless price breaches the ADD target by an additional 5%.</p>

        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span> -- Cool-down active. Cash preservation during regime warning. Wait.</p>

        <h3>NVO -- Novo Nordisk (Track 3)</h3>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ~$48.58 | <strong>Target:</strong> $50 (START) / $45 (ADD) | <strong>P/E:</strong> 13.8x forward vs 30x 5Y average</p>

        <p>Consensus NONE across all three analysts for the third consecutive session. The P/E collapse continues to signal structural competitive loss to Eli Lilly, not a temporary tantrum. Thesis remains weakening. Do not touch.</p>

        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> <span class="decision-badge none">NONE</span> -- Falling knife. Thesis weakening.</p>

        <div class="process-fix">
            <h3>Process Upgrade: Cool-Down Rule</h3>
            <p>The Auditor proposed a new rule to prevent mechanical pyramiding during regime warnings:</p>
            <p><strong>Cool-down rule:</strong> No ADDs within 1-3 trading days of a fill during an active regime warning, unless price breaches the ADD target by an additional 5% or more.</p>
            <p>This prevents the system from adding to positions too aggressively during tape-driven selloffs while preserving the ability to accumulate when prices genuinely crater through targets. The rule will be considered for formal addition to the methodology at the next annual review.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Calendar Flags</h2>
        <p><strong>FICO:</strong> At $1,381 and drifting toward the $1,300 ADD target. If the selloff continues, this could trigger within days.</p>
        <p><strong>TYL:</strong> Worth revisiting when regime warning clears. Forward P/E of 27x vs 55x 5Y average is significant compression for a government software monopoly.</p>
        <p><strong>NVO:</strong> Thesis reassessment at annual review. Three consecutive NONE sessions with "weakening" thesis.</p>
        <p><strong>Regime warning:</strong> At 11 triggers, watch for stabilization. When triggers fall below 5, Track 2 entries become eligible again.</p>
