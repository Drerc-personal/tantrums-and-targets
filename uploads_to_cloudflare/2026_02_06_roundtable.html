        <h1>Roundtable: February 6, 2026</h1>
        <p class="text-muted"><strong>The NVO Lesson:</strong> Three AIs almost bought a falling buggy whip. A 13x P/E isn't cheap when the company is losing its market. The Arbiter places 5 disciplined GTCs and introduces a new P/E compression warning.</p>

        <!-- Market Context -->
        <h2>Market Context</h2>
        <p>A broadly green day with 13 stocks triggering alerts. NVO rallied +9.9% off the lows, tempting all three analysts to call it a buying opportunity. VRSN dropped -7.6% on registry fears. Meanwhile, several quality compounders (MCO, JKHY) drifted toward their Track 3 targets.</p>
        <p>The regime warning remains active (9 Track 2 triggers in 10 days), reinforcing the default: skip Track 2, focus on Track 3 discipline.</p>

            <h3>REGIME WARNING ACTIVE</h3>
            <p><strong>9 Track 2 triggers in the last 10 days</strong> (threshold: 5)</p>
            <p>Broad market stress, not stock-specific opportunities. Track 2 entries suspended. One Track 2 candidate today (VRSN) was downgraded to Track 3 GTC only.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- NVO Thesis Break -->
        <div class="thesis-break">
            <h3>NVO: The Buggy Whip Test</h3>
            <p>All three AIs initially recommended buying NVO. A 13x P/E for the GLP-1 "global leader" looked like a gift. But the human investor pushed back: <em>"I don't know if NVO's thesis is still intact."</em></p>
            <p>Research confirmed the concern:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 1.5rem;">
                <li>Novo guided 2026 sales and profit <span class="fail">declining 5-13%</span> - not slowing, <em>declining</em></li>
                <li>Lilly's tirzepatide delivers 20% weight loss vs Novo's 14% - the efficacy gap is structural</li>
                <li>Semaglutide patent expiring in China, Brazil, Canada - generic competition incoming</li>
                <li>Lilly protected into the 2030s; Novo is being squeezed from above and below</li>
                <li>U.S. chief departed; second leadership shakeup in a year</li>
                <li>Stock down 46.5% in 2025 - the market was already telling us this</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Exit criteria check:</strong> "GLP-1 competition erodes pricing power >30%"</p>
            <p><strong>Status:</strong> Mid-teens U.S. price cuts plus MFN pricing deals are approaching this threshold. <span class="fail">Thesis: WEAKENING</span>. A stock doesn't go from 35x to 13x because of a tantrum - that's a re-rating.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- The Key Question -->
        <div class="lesson-box">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c5282;">The Question Nobody Asked</h3>
            <p>The prompt showed NVO at P/E 13.1x. All three AIs saw "cheap" and pattern-matched to "buying opportunity." Nobody asked: <strong>Why is a former 35x P/E company now trading at 13x?</strong></p>
            <p>A P/E compression of 60%+ is not a tantrum. It's the market repricing the business from "growth leader" to "legacy incumbent." The Narrator (Gemini) later called it exactly right: <em>"The narrative has shifted from a quality tantrum to a structural Great Divergence."</em></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>The fix:</strong> We're adding a P/E compression warning to the system. When current P/E is less than 50% of the 5-year average, the prompt will flag: <span class="fail">P/E COLLAPSED - Possible structural re-rating - investigate before buying</span>. This would have caught NVO before any analyst touched it.</p>

            <ol style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Regime warning is still active.</strong> 9 Track 2 triggers in 10 days. Not the time for aggressive DAY orders that expire worthless if the stock bounces.</li>
                <li><strong>VRSN: Skip Track 2, use Track 3.</strong> Both analysts wanted DAY orders at different prices. The GTC at $220 (target) is the disciplined play - if Mr. Market keeps panicking, we get a better fill. If it bounces, we didn't overpay.</li>
                <li><strong>NVO: The process caught a falling buggy whip.</strong> All three AIs pattern-matched "13x P/E = cheap" without asking why the multiple collapsed 60%. The human's pushback forced the research that revealed a structural deterioration, not a tantrum.</li>
                <li><strong>MCO and JKHY: Textbook Track 3.</strong> Full consensus on MCO. Both near target with intact theses. GTCs at target prices. This is the system working as designed.</li>

            <p><strong>New rule:</strong> When current P/E is less than 50% of the 5-year average P/E, the prompt will flag:</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This requires a new column in the Static sheet (5-year average P/E) and a check in the alert logic. For NVO, the 5-year average was ~30x and current is 13x - a 57% compression that would have triggered this warning before any analyst saw "cheap."</p>

            <p><strong>The NVO Lesson - Feb 6, 2026:</strong></p>
            <p><em>"Three AIs saw a 13x P/E and said 'buy.' The human said 'wait.' The research confirmed the human was right. A stock that goes from 35x to 13x isn't cheap - it's being re-rated. We don't want to catch falling buggy whips. The system now includes a P/E compression warning to prevent this pattern from repeating."</em></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Discipline Over Conviction - Feb 6, 2026:</strong></p>
            <p><em>"The Narrator recommended 3 BUYs with 70-85% confidence. The Auditor approved 7 actions. The Arbiter placed 5 patient GTCs and rejected the rest. During a regime warning, GTCs at target prices are always the right answer. DAY orders during volatility are gambling, not investing."</em></p>
